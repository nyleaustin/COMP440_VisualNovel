Episode 5: An Aggie Love Story or An Aggie Love Triangle
[Scene 1: Recap of the Previous Night]
The screen opens with flashes of last night’s events

[Scene 2: The Call from Jaylin]
The reader’s phone rings. It's Jaylin. They answer.
Jaylin (on the phone):
 “Hey… I know things got messy last night. I’m really sorry about that. I want to make it right. There’s this GHOE concert tonight, and I’ve got tickets. It’d be just you and me, no drama. I promise. Please... come with me?”
The reader hesitates, feeling conflicted. Jaylin’s voice softens.
Jaylin (earnestly):
 “You know I care about you. I just... I hate that things got weird. Let me make it up to you tonight. Trust me.”
The screen splits as the reader looks at the text from Keem, still up on the phone.

[Scene 3: The Heart-to-Heart with Imani]
Cut to the reader’s dorm room. The reader walks in to find their roommate Imani lounging on the bed, scrolling through her phone.
Imani (teasing):
 “Let me guess, you’ve got a dilemma. Jaylin or Keem, right?”
The reader nods, sitting down on their bed.
Reader:
 “Yeah, I don’t know what to do. Jaylin’s offering me GHOE tickets, but Keem... he wants me to come to this tailgate and dinner. I feel like I’m choosing between two totally different vibes, you know?”
Imani (playfully):
 “Girl, listen. You can’t let anyone decide for you. Just go with what feels right. Sometimes, you’ve gotta follow your heart. 
The reader sighs, clearly appreciative of Imani’s advice but still unsure.

(Alex): “I’m going to go out with Alex”
(Keem): “I’m going to go out with Keem.”

[Scene 4: Reader’s Decision – Option 1: The Concert with Jaylin]
If the reader chooses the concert with Jaylin:
Cut to the vibrant scene of the GHOE concert. The atmosphere is electric, filled with music, flashing lights, and dancing. Jaylin and the reader are walking through the crowd, laughing and vibing to the music.
Jaylin (grinning):
 “You look amazing. I’m glad you decided to come.”
Just as the moment feels perfect, the crowd erupts with cheers as Mariah the Scientist steps onto the stage. The crowd goes wild.
But then, out of nowhere, Vanessa appears in the crowd, a sharp glare in her eyes as she walks up to the reader and Jaylin.
Vanessa (with a fake smile):
 “Well, well, well. Look who showed up. You know, I did tell you to stay away from my man.”
The tension is instant. Vanessa’s eyes narrow as she stares the reader down. Jaylin looks uncomfortable, shifting awkwardly.
Vanessa (pointing at the reader):
 “You should’ve listened, but now you’re gonna learn the hard way.”
Before anyone can react, Vanessa pulls a gun from her bag and shoots it upward into the air. The sound of gunfire echoes, and chaos erupts. People scream and run in every direction.
They push their way through the panicking crowd, hearts racing. Everyone else is running
Jaylin (panting, pulling them into an alley):
 “I’m sorry, that’s not how I wanted the night to go. Are you okay?”
The reader nods, but the sense of danger lingers in the air.
Reader:
 “Yea, I just think we need to take a step back until you figure out whatever is going on with you and Vanessa.”

[Scene 5: Reader’s Decision – Option 2: Tailgate and Dinner with Keem]
If the reader chooses the tailgate and dinner with Keem:
The scene opens with Keem’s car parked at a lively tailgate. Music thumps in the background as people drink, dance, and chat. Keem is grinning, handing the reader a drink.
Keem (smiling):
 “I told you this would be the vibe. You’re gonna have a blast. No stress, no weirdness, just fun.”
The reader smiles.
Reader (laughing):
“I mean, it’s a lot, but it’s definitely fun. I didn’t know this many people were just out here drinking and dancing before dinner.”
Keem:
“Yeah, Aggies know how to tailgate. We do it big. It's like a party before the party. You ever seen a grill that big?”
He gestures to a giant tailgate grill that's practically spitting out smoke and sizzling burgers. The reader laughs.
Reader:
“No, but I think I’m about to get some food from it. It smells like heaven.”
Keem (smiling):
“Same, but don’t get too full. After the tailgate, we’re gonna hit this spot for dinner. Trust me, you’ll love it.”
____________________________________________________________________________
Reader:
“This restaurant is really nice, thank you so much for bringing me.”
Keem:
“Its no problem! I’ve been wanting to have a chance to sit down and get to know you better. Hows your year been so far?”
Reader (looking around):
 “It’s all a little overwhelming, honestly. College, relationships... I didn’t expect it to be like this. I thought dating was supposed to be easier.”
Keem takes a deep breath, setting his drink down. His expression shifts, and he looks the reader in the eye.
Keem (seriously):
 “Look, I get it. But just to be real with you, I’m not really into the whole relationship thing right now. You’re cool, don’t get me wrong, but I’m not sure I want anything exclusive. Like, I just wanna have fun... you know?”
The reader feels a pang of disappointment, but Keem gives a reassuring smile.
[The Player has the option to respond.]
(Annoyed): “So what..you wanna do relationship typa stuff without the label.”
(Understanding): “Its cool. You do your thing and I’’ do my thing.”
Keem (shrugging):
 “I’m not saying I don’t like you, just… you know how it is.”
The reader nods, processing his words as they sit down with their drinks. Keem’s phone buzzes and he checks it, looking distracted.

[Scene 6: The Aftermath]
The reader, feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by the day’s events
Reader hears a knock and looks at the door.
Reader:
 “Who—?”
Reader opens the door and scans whoever stands there from head to toe
Whoever stands at the door:
 “Hey can we talk…”
The reader stands frozen, the weight of their decisions hanging in the air. The screen fades to black.

Text on Screen: “To Be Continued…”
End of episode.
