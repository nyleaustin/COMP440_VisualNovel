Episode 4: GHOE 
Scene 1: Dorm Room with Imani
[The Player is sitting on the bed, looking over notes and papers. Imani is pacing around the room, clearly excited.]
Imani:
GHOE week is here, and I can barely keep my head on straight! We’ve got the tailgate on Saturday and the concert right after—
She pauses, throwing her hands up in exasperation
How’s that project you have due this week coming along. 
Player:
Honestly? I'm freaking out. How do we even survive GHOE week and the project in the same breath?
You roll your eyes but laugh, trying to stay calm.
I’m excited for the tailgate, though. I’m gonna need a break after all this madness.
Imani:
Tell me about it. I’m ready for some fun. She pauses, grinning mischievously.
But first, you have to help me figure out what parties we’re going to this week. I heard College Daze parties are the place to be.
Player:
We can figure it out later. First things first—let's just get through this week in one piece, okay?
Imani:
Fair enough. I just need to survive the parties and tailgate without embarrassing myself.
[The Player nods, and the scene transitions to the class.]

Scene 2: Class Presentation
[The class is buzzing with excitement as the project presentations begin. Professor Leflore calls the Players's group to the front.]
Narrator:
It’s time to present your project. You glance at your partner(s)—Jaylin or Keem—and they give you an encouraging smile, ready for whatever happens. Will it be a laid-back presentation or a serious one? Only one way to find out.

If the Player teamed up with Jaylin:
Jaylin (grinning as he stands next to the Player, holding a stack of slides):
Alright, class, get ready for the most entertaining project of the semester.
[Insert Tetris Mini game]
If the Player teamed up with Keem:
Keem (adjusting his glasses and clearing his throat):
“Good afternoon, class. We have researched different types of games and have developed an engaging Tetris game.”
[Insert Tetris Mini game]
Scene 3: Cafeteria Drama
[Later, the Player is sitting with Imani in the cafeteria, discussing GHOE plans and the parties they’re going to. The energy is light, and everyone’s buzzing about the uPlayeroming weekend.]
Imani:
Okay, so tailgate first, then we hit the concert, and after that, it’s the party at the Que House. Sounds like a solid plan to me.
She grins and takes a bite of her sandwich.
What about you? Got your eye on anyone?
Player (laughing nervously):
Not sure about anyone yet... but I’m just focused on surviving the weekend first.
[Suddenly, Vanessa, Jaylin's ex-girlfriend, walks by with a group of friends and stops when she notices the Player.]
Vanessa (smirking, crossing her arms):
Well, well. If it isn’t the girl who thinks she’s special enough to get with Jaylin.
She raises an eyebrow, clearly ready to stir some trouble.
“You do know that even though we broke up, he’s still my man. So, I have to ask... are you gonna stay away from him?”


[The Player has the option to respond.]
(Yes, Cost 50 Flex Dollars): “Yes, I’ll stay away from him. I don’t want any drama.”
(No, Free Choice): “No, I’m not going anywhere. Jaylin can make his own choices.”
Vanessa (smiling coldly):
“Good luck with that. I’m just letting you know. He’ll always be mine, no matter what.”
She turns on her heel and walks away, leaving the Player and Imani in an awkward silence.

Scene 4: Phone Call from Jaylin
[Later that day, the Player gets a call from Jaylin. His name lights up on the screen, and the Player answers.]
Jaylin (sounding apologetic):
Hey, I just wanted to say sorry about Vanessa earlier. She... well, she can be a little crazy sometimes.
He laughs nervously, as if he doesn’t quite know what else to say.
“I just wanted to clear things up.”
Player (coldly):
“Jaylin, I didn’t know you were still talking to her. What’s going on between you two?”
The tension is clear in your voice.
“You’re still really close, aren’t you?”
Jaylin (defensive but calm):
“Look, it’s not like that. Ness and I have been through a lot together. Yeah, we still talk sometimes, but it’s just... she’s been around for a long time. But she’s not my girl anymore.”
Player (feeling unsettled):
“Ness? How close are you two if you still call her that?”
You pause, letting the words hang in the air, but the answer isn’t clear enough.


[The Player has the option to respond.]
(Crashout: 10 Flex Dollars): “You and that big headed ##### got me ###### up”
(Understanding) : “Yea.. I get it. Sometimes you have those exs its hard to get away from”
(Annoyed): “Whatever yall got going on leave me out of it.” 

[The Player hangs up the phone, the doubts lingering. The scene transitions as they sit down, deep in thought.]

Scene 5: Text from Keem
[Before going to bed, the Player receives a text message from Keem.]
Keem’s Text:
Hey, I was wondering... are you free on Saturday? I was thinking we could go to the game together and grab dinner afterward. What do you think?
[The scene fades to black as the Player is left staring at the screen, unsure of how to respond.]

Cliffhanger:
Narrator:
With Jaylin's ex in the picture and Keem’s invitation hanging in the air, the choices are piling up. Will you let the past with Jaylin get in the way, or take a chance with Keem?
[The screen fades to black.]
